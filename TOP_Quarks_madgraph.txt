# MY_WORK
# MadGraph for Top Quarks
>> mkdir madgraph

Install MadGraph with latest version (check it, i am using MG5_aMC_v3.5.7):

>> wget launchpad.net/madgraph5/3.0/3.4.x/+download/MG5_aMC_v3.5.7.tar.gz
>> tar xf MG5_aMC_v3.5.7.tar.gz
>> rm MG5_aMC_v3.6.0.tar.gz

Download models from (download the whole repo as you like and copy models in the Madgraph models dir):
https://github.com/LHC-DMWG/model-repository/tree/DMSimp_t
>> git clone https://github.com/LHC-DMWG/model-repository.git
copy Pseudoscalar_2HDM from model-repository/models to MG5_aMC_v3_4_0/models directory.

>> Model explanation can be found here:
https://github.com/LHC-DMWG/model-repository/blob/DMSimp_t/models/Pseudoscalar_2HDM/README.txt

[for lxplus at CERN use it. 
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/LCG_98python3/Python/3.7.6/x86_64-centos7-gcc10-opt/Python-env.sh]

Update the python3.8 dependency, see the question https://answers.launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo/+question/700490
>> sudo apt update
>> sudo apt install python3.8-dev

Run MGraph:
>> python3.8 ./bin/mg5_aMC

Install LHAPDF:
>> install lhapdf6

Now run MGraph:
For four top quarks:

>> ./bin/mg5_aMC
For proton prton fusion:

>> generate p p > t t~ t t~ 



>> display diagrams (optional for diagrams checking)
>> output template_pp_tttt

Generate events:
>> launch
After completing this process 
we get a file in .gz formate in this directory  (MG5_aMC_v3_5_6/bin/template_pp_tttt/Events/run_01)
extact file so it will convert into .lhe file
